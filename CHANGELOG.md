## [Unreleased]

Nothing is released yet: the name, the logo and the first tag are still open.
What follows is what exists and runs.

### Added

- **Collector** that stages links before anything downloads, with name, size,
  availability and the backend that will take each one. A link no backend
  handles is still shown, with the reason attached, and can be rechecked
  without re-pasting.
- **Crawling**: a pasted page becomes the files it links to. Only a link no real
  backend recognised is opened, so a plain download costs no extra request.
- **Resolvers** for direct links, TorBox, AllDebrid and Real-Debrid, yt-dlp, and
  a headless JDownloader as the catch-all. When a backend says a link is not its
  business, the next one gets a turn.
- **Scheduler** with global and per-host concurrency, priorities, manual queue
  order, and automatic retries with a growing delay.
- **Speed limit** that applies to everything and takes effect on downloads
  already running. The embedded engine has no rate-limit hook, so its traffic
  goes through a loopback proxy where the bytes are metered.
- **Download folders**: a global folder, an optional per-package subfolder, a
  per-task override, and path templates such as
  `/downloads/<jd:date>/<jd:hoster>/<jd:packagename>`.
- **Extraction** of zip, rar including multi-volume, 7z including split volumes,
  tar, gz, bz2, xz and zst. A multi-part set waits for every part before it
  opens. Encrypted rar and 7z take passwords, tried per task first and then from
  a configured list.
- **Checksum verification** against an `.sfv`, `.md5` or `.sha*` that arrived
  with the batch, or a CRC in the file name.
- **Click'n'Load** from a site's own button, including the preflight modern
  browsers require before a page may reach a loopback address. The same binary
  runs as a bridge for instances that are not on the browser's own machine.
- **Watched folder** for `.txt` and JDownloader `.crawljob` drop files, carrying
  package name, destination and archive password.
- **Multi-instance federation**: register other KnightLoaders and drive them all
  from one dashboard, with no relay in between.
- **Access control**: an optional password lock with signed session cookies,
  off by default.
- **The download list is a real table**: sortable columns you choose, packages
  drawn as rows of their own with a folder glyph and a triangle that collapses
  them, and a right-click menu on packages and files. Which packages are folded
  survives a reload.
- **Settings** as thirteen sub-pages behind one shell, with the set and the order
  coming from the server so the tab bar, the modules page and the index all read
  one list. Among them a **module registry** whose switches really do switch a
  subsystem off, a **connection manager**, and an **Advanced** page generated
  from the Go configuration struct by reflection, so a new setting cannot be
  added without becoming visible.
- **Rules**: the Packagizer and the link filter in one editor, and a holding area
  that keeps what a filter caught instead of discarding it, so a rule that was
  too broad can be seen and undone.
- **Reconnect** in four methods: run a program, replay recorded HTTP requests,
  UPnP (which needs no router details at all, because it asks the network where
  the gateway is), or run a script through a named interpreter. A recorded
  LiveHeader `[[[HSRC]]]` script imports directly, reporting which of its blocks
  mapped alongside which did not. The automatic reconnect fires only when a
  backend itself asked for a later retry, never while the queue is halted, and
  never more than one at a time.
- **Native desktop applications** for Windows, macOS and Linux alongside the
  container. The window is a webview served by the very same HTTP handler the
  container serves, so the engine, the resolvers, the API and the interface are
  not a second implementation that can drift from the first. Every release tag
  builds all three and attaches them to the release.
- **42 languages**, each fetched only when chosen, right-to-left included.
- **GlimStone**, the design language the interface is built on, documented in
  `docs/design-language.md`. Its CSS prefix is `glim-`. The palette is IBM
  Carbon, the same values the sibling apps already use: a shared design language
  has to share the ground first, so GlimStone contributes the system rather than
  a second set of greys.
- **Adjustable corners** — round, soft or square — driven by one token, so the
  whole interface changes together instead of arriving half converted.
- **Adjustable accent** with eight presets and a free colour. The text placed on
  the accent is derived from its luminance rather than configured separately.
- **Rainbow accent**: a palette of eight hues handed out by position, so a long
  download list reads as separate rows. Position, not a hash of the task id: the
  hash kept a row's colour when the rows above it finished, which sounds better
  until three rows share eight buckets and two neighbours come out the same
  colour, which is the one thing the mode exists to prevent. It has a reactive
  mode that rests neutral and colours only what is hovered or running, an
  optional rotation of the starting hue, and all eight colours are editable.
- **Info bubbles.** An explanation now sits behind a neutral `(i)` beside its
  label instead of as grey prose under the control. It opens on hover and on
  focus, closes on Escape, and is rendered at document level so no card or
  scroll container can clip it.
- **BitTorrent and magnet links** as a fourth resolver alongside direct links,
  yt-dlp and JDownloader: selective per-file download, a seed-to-ratio-or-
  duration target, port mapping, and a private torrent's own metadata
  switching off DHT and peer exchange for it automatically, no toggle
  required.

### Security

- The API no longer sends a wildcard CORS header and the WebSocket no longer
  accepts any origin, which together stopped another website from driving an
  instance through the visitor's browser.
- The Click'n'Load endpoints accept POST only. Answering GET made them a browser
  simple request, which any page could have used to queue downloads and archive
  passwords without the user knowing.
- The JDownloader provisioner fetches over HTTPS and checks the downloaded bytes
  really are an archive before executing them.

### Fixed

- Removing a task no longer deletes what was downloaded. That was data loss on
  the ordinary "clear finished" path.
- Task IDs are checked for collisions before entering the map, where a duplicate
  would have silently orphaned a running download.
- A single compressed file unpacks beside its archive instead of into a folder
  named after the file it produces.
- A bracketed run of eight digits is no longer read as a CRC32, which had been
  stamping intact downloads as corrupt.
- A byte-order mark no longer eats the first link of a dropped text file.
- One slow WebSocket viewer no longer delays progress updates for everybody
  else.
- The embedded UI carries an ETag and revalidates, so a redeploy cannot leave a
  browser on a stale bundle.
- A private torrent's DHT and peer exchange refusal, and the seed-ratio,
  seed-duration and port settings on the Torrents page, are now actually
  carried into a running download - all four were previously saved and
  validated but never reached the torrent engine.
- A script started at the moment of shutdown can no longer outlive it. Asking
  "is the host still open?" and signing up to be waited for were two separate
  steps, so a run that slipped between them went untracked: shutdown returned
  while the script kept calling into an app being torn down around it, and the
  same gap could trip Go's own guard against that pattern and take the process
  down. The two steps are now one.
