package relay

// The wire protocol both ends of a relay connection speak. The relay server
// and the client an instance dials it with marshal these same types, so a
// renamed field cannot land on one side only.
//
// Bodies travel as []byte, which encoding/json carries as base64. One JSON
// text frame per message keeps the protocol usable from a plain WebSocket
// client with nothing but a JSON parser (the mobile app). File downloads
// (GET /api/tasks/{id}/file) pass through here too: sealed, but base64 in a
// single frame whose length the relay can see, not a stream.
