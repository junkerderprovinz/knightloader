// The secret behind a connection phrase and the key that groups instances on
// a relay are different values. The relay key travels in the clear in every
// hello frame, so it is derived from the secret with a hash: a relay learns
// an identifier for the group and never the secret that would reproduce its
// phrase. Proxy frames are sealed with a second key derived from the same
// secret under its own domain (see seal.go).

// which is why KL_RELAY_DOMAIN takes a list (see cmd/knightloader-relay).
