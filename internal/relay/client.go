package relay

// The instance side of the relay: one outbound WebSocket an instance keeps
// open to a relay, so two instances behind NAT reach each other without
// either accepting an inbound connection.
//
// The client depends on protocol.go and the standard library only, because
// the desktop build, which has no listener and can only be paired this way,
// uses it as well as the container build. Unlike Server it has no queue or
// writer goroutine: it has one peer, so a slow write only delays its own
// caller, and coder/websocket serializes concurrent writes itself.
