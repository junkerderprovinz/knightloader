// The donation addresses, grouped BY CHAIN rather than by coin (#3524).
//
// That grouping is the whole safety property of this file, and it came out of
// the list as it was first written down: it named 'Tether' with the networks
// 'BNB, Tron, Solana, Ethereum' above a single 0x… address. That address exists
// on EVM chains only. It is not a Tron address (those start with T) and not a
// Solana one, so a donor picking Tron would have sent USDT into nothing and the
// money would be gone. Nobody would ever have reported it, because the person
// it happens to is a stranger who never writes.
//
// One line per ADDRESS, with the coins it can receive as a subtitle: then the
// donor picks a chain that the address actually lives on, and the wrong choice
// is not offered. A coin that needs a chain we have no address for is simply
// absent (Tron, deliberately).
//
// Verified before shipping, as far as each format allows: the Bitcoin address
// passes its bech32 checksum, the XRP address its base58check, the Solana one
// decodes to 32 bytes, and the two EVM/Sui ones are well-formed hex of the
// right length. The XRP account was also checked on the ledger — an XRP account
// must hold a base reserve before it exists at all, and a donation to a
// non-existent account is REJECTED rather than lost.
