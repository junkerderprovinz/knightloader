// The donation addresses ([3524], regrouped as coin-then-chain in [3554]).
//
// WHAT MAKES THIS LIST SAFE: every network a donor can pick carries its OWN
// address. There is no line anywhere that names a chain without an address to
// go with it, so the wrong choice is not merely discouraged, it cannot be
// made.
//
// That property is the whole reason this file is shaped the way it is, and it
// came out of the list as it was FIRST written: it named 'Tether' with the
// networks 'BNB, Tron, Solana, Ethereum' above a single 0x… address. That
// address exists on EVM chains only. It is not a Tron address (those start
// with T) and not a Solana one, so a donor picking Tron would have sent USDT
// into nothing and the money would be gone. Nobody would ever have reported
// it, because the person it happens to is a stranger who never writes.
//
// The second version fixed that by offering CHAINS only, with the coins as a
// subtitle. This one offers coins again, the way a donor actually thinks ("I
// have USDT"), and keeps the property by making the chain a second, real
// choice underneath: pick USDT and you pick between Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain
// and Solana, each of which resolves to an address that lives there. Tron is
// absent, as it was before, because there is no Tron address.
//
// Verified before shipping, as far as each format allows, and in a test rather
// than by eye (donate.test.ts): the Bitcoin address passes its bech32
// checksum, the XRP address its base58check, the Solana one decodes to 32
// bytes, and the two EVM/Sui ones are well-formed hex of the right length. The
// XRP account was also checked on the ledger — an XRP account must hold a base
// reserve before it exists at all, and a donation to a non-existent account is
// REJECTED rather than lost.
